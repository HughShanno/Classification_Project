Title: Classification Project

This is a class project for the Oregon Episcopal School fall 2019 machine learning course

Instructions for what to code in each cell were written above each cell by the class teacher,
I then implemented the code as specified.

This project reads in a database of colleges with a number of attributes for each college and applies a number of various classification models to analyze the data in order to predict whether a college is for-profit or non-profit.
